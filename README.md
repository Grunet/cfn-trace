The easiest way to get started playing with the repository is to click on the
above link and create a (free) Gitpod account using your Github credentials.
This will open a workspace in your browser that should have all of the necessary
tools ready to go (you can do the same from a fork if you're working on a PR,
just use your fork's repository in the URL instead of this one's.)
